# initrd service order for ZFS "lake" and its credstore
# 1) modprobe@zfs.service: load ZFS kernel module
# 2) import-lake-bare.service: wait for USB devices, then `zpool import -N` for pool "lake"
#    - Ordered after the USB disk .device units; before/wants cryptsetup-pre.target
# 3) systemd-cryptsetup@lake-credstore.service: open LUKS on /dev/zvol/lake/credstore
# 4) etc-lake-credstore.mount: mount /etc/lake-credstore (from fstab)
# 5) lake-load-key.service: RequiresMountsFor=/etc/credstore; ImportCredential=zfs-lake.mount;
#    runs `zfs load-key` for dataset lake/crypt
# 6) sysroot.mount and initrd.target continue; switch-root is ordered to wait until credstore
#    units can stop cleanly via conflicts/after
