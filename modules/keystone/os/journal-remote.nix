# TODO(upstream-keystone): temporary consumer fork of
# modules/os/journal-remote.nix while ks-config migrates its Keystone adapters.
# Current nixpkgs removed services.journald.remote.listen; enabling the service,
# setting its port, and overriding the socket listener are sufficient.
#
# Centralized journal collection via systemd-journal-remote/upload.
#
# Implements REQ-020 (Centralized Journal Collection)
# See docs/specs/REQ-020-journal-remote.md
#
# Configuration is auto-derived from keystone.hosts: the host with
# `journalRemote = true` becomes the server, all other hosts auto-forward
# via systemd-journal-upload. No per-host config needed in nixos-config.
#
# TRANSPORT: When keystone.domain is set, uploads use HTTPS via the nginx
# reverse proxy (journal.<domain>). The server-side nginx vhost is registered
# by modules/server/services/journal-remote.nix. When no domain is set,
# the module falls back to direct HTTP over Tailscale.
