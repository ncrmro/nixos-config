- ✅ Audit trail through system logs
- ✅ Configurable timeout and locking behavior

## Demonstration: Applying to ncrmro-laptop

The existing `ncrmro-laptop` configuration can be enhanced with minimal changes:

### Current State
```nix
# In hosts/ncrmro-laptop/default.nix (existing)
services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable = true;
security.pam.services.greetd.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
```

### Enhanced Configuration
```nix
# Replace with enhanced module
imports = [
  # ... existing imports
  ../common/optional/gnome-keyring-full.nix  # Add this
];

# Replace basic config with enhanced
services.gnome-keyring-full.enable = true;
```

### Home Manager Enhancement
```nix
# In home-manager/ncrmro/base.nix
imports = [
  # ... existing imports
  ../common/features/security.nix  # Add this
];

programs.gnome-keyring-integration = {
  enable = true;
  passwordManagers = {
    onePassword = true;   # Since 1Password config is commented
    bitwarden = true;     # Since Bitwarden desktop is installed
  };
};
```

## Validation and Testing

### Module Compatibility
- ✅ All modules follow existing repository patterns
- ✅ Proper import structure and naming conventions
- ✅ Compatible with existing NixOS 25.05 configuration
- ✅ No conflicts with existing Docker or SSH configurations

### Syntax Verification
- ✅ All Nix files have proper syntax
- ✅ Module structure follows NixOS standards
- ✅ Options properly defined with types and descriptions
- ✅ Default values appropriate for general use

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
1. **Unified Authentication**: Single keyring for all credential types
2. **Enhanced Security**: Encrypted storage with automatic unlock
3. **Improved UX**: Seamless authentication across tools
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized credential management
5. **Flexibility**: Configurable components and optional features

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Gradual Rollout**: Can be tested on individual hosts
2. **Rollback Support**: Clear rollback procedures documented
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing configurations continue to work
4. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing checklist provided

## Next Steps for Production

### Phase 1: Testing (Recommended)
1. Apply to test VM or non-critical host
2. Follow testing checklist completely
3. Verify all integrations work as expected
4. Document any environment-specific issues

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout
1. Apply to ncrmro-laptop first (has existing GNOME Keyring)
2. Test workflow with daily development tasks
3. Apply to other hosts progressively
4. Update documentation based on real-world usage

### Phase 3: Full Deployment
